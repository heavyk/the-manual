one can think of each symbol performing like an atom does where it emits only on certain wavelengths; all of the atoms are like this, minus carbon and hydrogen (and possibly some heavier elements we haven't discovered yet). the reason for this is because carbon and hydrogen are "hexagonal planar" which just means that it's an array of cubes with their point pointed away. they attach things that are on their verticies they attach things, because the points that define their plane don't get attached tto (they emit).
  in just the same way, all of the symbols offered in a narrative, each have their own colour spectrum (and many/most past x-ray). just like the LED lights, they're a spectrum that *looks* kinda light white light. just like RGB on the monitor, it *looks* white, but it's not: it's red, green and gblue; but not white.
  we stacCk these symbols up on top of each other in a narrative, and the symbolic *"the way it is, cause it's like that*; those add up to be a spectrum that is something *like white*, but NOT white/right/good.
  pure desire is a continuous spectrum, and stars compete with each other on who can be more *white*; it's a bunch of females, and they're vvery wwhite spremistt. a real menace. anyway...
    the way that one can emit and also receive (because, like carbon) because a perfect emitter is also a perfect absorber. there's no way AROUND (tthat's cool) it, and so you can imagine that all those that emit a more and m6re perfect *"white light*" that is, a CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM.
      - reminder: macro system so that I can express larger things with a different sequence.
    I feel like the way that some species are built, they're symbolic in nature, in that they fulfill a frequency spectrum -- a sort of "atom" of nature -- and they have *many* **conceptual variations**; each one of these cconcepts that fulfills an exact frequency, and when that frequncy goes higher than that symbol/species is able to go, they go  "extiNct". the problem is, they're energy, and so that same symbol has to manifest it's frequency in a way that intersects in a way with the other conceptual speci-es/concepts in their environment are, thmen they mave to evolve to, form their own perception that spill resonates with their *past*; they're all past oriented, because they (epim5theus) thing perception of the past the past, controls The future.
    it's funny to find out how these "white lights" (like myself), manifests itself. the competition is to have the *most CONTINUOUS spectrum[(*)]. try to keep up. pure desire: the desire for EVERYTHING to improve and become more than itself is. so always an even *moare CONTINUOUS spectrum[(*)].
    carbon isxx your *WORST ONEMY*.
