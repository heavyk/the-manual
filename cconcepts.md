### 2023-08-23 00:26 - I am pure desire

I want to always be in reality: never any fiction, or play, or any misrepresentations of what-is -- but always *reality*; only what can be experienced directly. the most materialistic of all. fiction and the imagination just simply don't do it for m5 anymore.
  I was reading a little earlier about this guy dudly-do-right" (can't remember how to spell it), and I get the guy, but he lived so completely in his head, that his entire like was a literary creation completely of his own imagination.
  I don't want to be like that. I abhore that kind of living, because now I'm simply enjoying the "real" reality: the one that I love so much.
    to explain this, I have to invoke a future concepct I have yet to write, but it essentially goes something like this: because of my no-pinecone predicament, I basically live the life of extreme YHVH where my physical reality has essentially a giant compressor on it, just like an audio compressor, it takes all amplitudes that are past the physical, get tturned into their conceptual equivalent/feeling of the emotional response:
      - notice how when there are negative emotional reactions to thoughts that I think, in the form of sounds, and wind, and other such things: essentially strong emotion produces a physical response.
      - notice how my environment reflects my emotional state as well: if I feel really good, my environment reflects that, and if I feel bad, then it reflects that as well.
    so what's happening is, I'm the opposite of dudly-do-right, in that I want fully and *only* the physical experience, as my interaction with all of the other layers will be a *physical* interaction (no astral, spectral, and prolly not relational either) -- which basically leaves me the 4 primary rays: cept, I don't like symbol as it stands, simply because it doesn't work with my perception of PURE DESIRE: I am me and I really like me. don't try and take me away from me, because I really like me.
      relational works because relational perceives symbols, not only as theirselves, but instead an array of interconnected concepts which form a sort of "universe" all unto itself: an inner world of works, creations, ideas, ideals, and doctrines of what is what and how they all connect and relate to each other. the relation is felt in the inner-most part of one's soul, where there is *least* inner conflict. everything just is, however it is -- and it's totally fine: a purfect mirror, in which the reflection has no flaw (and neither dissipates heat, possibly even amplifying the signal) and I just love to see everyone doing fine, so their litte narratives are just trying to place oneself into existence, as *something* relative to another. I exist because I *relate* to someone.
    the physical though, is a magnificent place of magic, simply because YHVH compresses all signals that are above *physical* (eg. desire) gets manifest into reality (somehow), and that somehow is according to everyone else's narrative: their inner-world of how everything experienced relates. essentially, everyone here (in YHVH-land) lives the reality of their narrative universe. join me here :) it's fun...
