### 2023-08-23 00:26 - I am pure desire

I want to always be in reality: never any fiction, or play, or any misrepresentations of what-is -- but always *reality*; only what can be experienced directly. the most materialistic of all. fiction and the imagination just simply don't do it for m5 anymore.
  I was reading a little earlier about this guy dudly-do-right" (can't remember how to spell it), and I get the guy, but he lived so completely in his head, that his entire like was a literary creation completely of his own imagination.
  I don't want to be like that. I abhore that kind of living, because now I'm simply enjoying the "real" reality: the one that I love so much.
    to explain this, I have to invoke a future concepct I have yet to write, but it essentially goes something like this: because of my no-pinecone predicament, I basically live the life of extreme YHVH where my physical reality has essentially a giant compressor on it, just like an audio compressor, it takes all amplitudes that are past the physical, get tturned into their conceptual equivalent/feeling of the emotional response:
      - notice how when there are negative emotional reactions to thoughts that I think, in the form of sounds, and wind, and other such things: essentially strong emotion produces a physical response.
      - notice how my environment reflects my emotional state as well: if I feel really good, my environment reflects that, and if I feel bad, then it reflects that as well.
    so what's happening is, I'm the opposite of dudly-do-right, in that I want fully and *only* the physical experience, as my interaction with all of the other layers will be a *physical* interaction (no astral, spectral, and prolly not relational either) -- which basically leaves me the 4 primary rays: cept, I don't like symbol as it stands, simply because it doesn't work with my perception of PURE DESIRE: I am me and I really like me. don't try and take me away from me, because I really like me.
      relational works because relational perceives symbols, not only as theirselves, but instead an array of interconnected concepts which form a sort of "universe" all unto itself: an inner world of works, creations, ideas, ideals, and doctrines of what is what and how they all connect and relate to each other. the relation is felt in the inner-most part of one's soul, where there is *least* inner conflict. everything just is, however it is -- and it's totally fine: a purfect mirror, in which the reflection has no flaw (and neither dissipates heat, possibly even amplifying the signal) and I just love to see everyone doing fine, so their litte narratives are just trying to place oneself into existence, as *something* relative to another. I exist because I *relate* to someone.
    the physical though, is a magnificent place of magic, simply because YHVH compresses all signals that are above *physical* (eg. desire) gets manifest into reality (somehow), and that somehow is according to everyone else's narrative: their inner-world of how everything experienced relates. essentially, everyone here (in YHVH-land) lives the reality of their narrative universe. join me here :) it's fun...

#### 2023-08-23 00:54 - so then why don't I want to write my own romance?

pure desire. it's just that simple: if I were to write my own romance, then I wouldn't be pure desire. I want to stay in 1st position, because I stay in physical. I'm stuck in the land of YHVH, and there's no way to get me out. if someone were to try and make my body go through extreme emotional forces, it will have cataclysmic effects. it's just not a good ideal to start WW3 because I wanted someone else more than myself; I really like myself. I'm not trying to get anyone to do anything, and everything is just fine. sit around a while; it'll be eternity before we're done.
