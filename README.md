# the-manual

I finally decided that I want to write out my ideas in a cohesive way. I don't intend for this to be "the way" to explain these ideas, as there are many other ways to explain/perceive the same layers.

- [intro](/intro.md)
- (1) [desire](/desire.md)
- (2) [relational](/relational.md)/[motivation](/motivation.md)
- (3) [belief](/belief.md)/[symbol](/symbol.md)
- (5) [conceptual](/concept.md)/[emotion](/emotion.md)
- (6) [astral](/astral.md)/[imaginary](/imaginary.md)

concepts:
- I am [pure-desire](/concepts/pure-desire.md)
- I am [pure-evil](/concepts/pure-evil.md)
