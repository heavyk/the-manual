# the-manual

I finally decided that I want to write out my ideas in a cohesive way. I don't intend for this to be "the way" to explain these ideas, as there are many other ways to explain/perceive the same layers. instead, this repository is simply the-manual *to how my perception works*: how I perceive all things acting in accordance with each other; how my universe works.

#### layers of perception:
- [intro](/intro.md)
- (1) [desire](/desire.md)
  - (2) [relational](/relational.md)/[motivation](/motivation.md)
- (3) [belief](/belief.md)/[symbol](/symbol.md)
  - (4) [spectral](/spectral.md)/[zero-point](/zero-point)/[mid-point](/mid-point.md)
- (5) [conceptual](/concept.md)/[emotion](/emotion.md)
  - (6) [astral](/astral.md)/[imaginary](/imaginary.md)
- (7) [physical](/physical.md)

#### concepts:
- I am [pure-desire](/concepts/pure-desire.md)
- I am [pure-evil](/concepts/pure-evil.md)
