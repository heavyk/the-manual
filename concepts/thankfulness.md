# thankfulness

I am thankful that all of the awful things that *could* havve happened to me, didn't. there are so many terrible and awful things that I cannot see or even perceive, which, in another life, I could have seen. I live rejoicing in absence of all of that hurt, pain, terror, depression, misunderstanding, ... etc. so be it. lol.
