# saturnian triad

### 2023-12-12 16:54 - venus and thoth

I'm not 100% on this idea, but this is how I perceive it presently (as always, which is why these are timestamped): here on earth there seem to be only a relative few (<1%) people that are seemingly conscious and consciously guiding the their reality into being. the rest of the people seem to have a mix of vibrations from our different planets (symbolic archetypes). these conscious beings seem to be the ones that do great things, and start new cultures, and then once those cultures have been bootstrapped (meaning, they have a symbolic system in which communication occurs (verbal|written) and a set of archetypes/symbols that the different roles in the culture take on), then these cultures sorta go into autopilot and new children that are born seem to take on these thoth/venus roles.
venus represents pure-symbol (a good example of this is ereshkigal in innana's descent into the underworld), and she follows all of the rules the culture has laid out for her. she's a good wife, and raises children the way the culture says to do it (to the best of her ability, of course).
thoth is a 7th ray, which means he can interact with all of the rays with ease, but he's limited by the narrative.
    the reason why I believe that thoth is limited by the narrative goes way way back into a time when our solar-system was a traditional one, where the sun is the centre (now, the earth is the centre), and at that time tiamat (the 5th planet) was still around, so saturn was in the 7th position (and thoth in 1st position), meaning thoth and saturn had the full lenghth of the spectrum to work with.
        also, at that time, I'm pretty sure that each of the different planets represented their ray type: earth. these were the "legendary times" when things were backwards from how they are now. in the ray system, we're looking at a top-down system, where symbol (as determined by enki) governed all of reality. there's a bit that I can't fully see, because the solar system was different then, so instead of explaining I'll just say what I see: earth was symbolic at the time, mars and thoth are similar, and thoth may very well be the core of mars, and I'm pretty sure that venus is would be the same thing for jupiter (though I don't know about "core" I don't know how to express the idea -- OK, I got it). venus is jupiter, now receptive and narrated by the sun, and thoth is mars, (still emitter), but now narrated by the sun.
    however with the destruction of tiamat, saturn falls into 6th position, and somehow that takes thoth away from 7th ray perception, and aligns him with astral (6) perception instead. the result that this has is that he perceives everything symbolically, instead of physically; which is good, because writing and language are sorta important for anything productive -- but the disadvantage is that he's largely limited by the culture that he's born into.
the way I figure it, thoth is most XY males born into a society. from the sun's perspective, if the society needs more mailmen, then thoth is born with a desire to carry mail, and if the society needs more woodcutters, then he's a woodsman, etc. -- all the way up to the sciences and engineering. he's just the "plain joe" that gets born according to the combined narrative of the parents (both mentally and genetically). tantric sex I believe intensifies his narrative, and causes the thoth to be born with more drive and motivation. from the sun's perspective, the production of the thoth and venus children satisfy the needs of the society, and produce the narrated couplings that are desired by the imparting parents.
    from the sun's perspective, none of the creations of the thoths and venuses are anything other than finding resonance patterns between each individual in the societies' concept of those symbols. for those whom have compatible concepts of the symbols invoked, thoth and venus are born. so, as an example, let's say that I want a wife that has certain symbolic qualities, and then with her I want to have a son that fits another set of symbolic qualities. well, for the sun (whos perspective does not include time the way we think of it, but all possible configurations), automatically creates that future wife and son for me based on my symbolic desire -- and so all I have to do is to find a way to the concept/feeling of that reality in order to experience it. there are many other realities where thoth and venus are slightly different, and some work and some don't. because we navigate conceptually now (and not symbolically), there are infinite variations to all of the desired thoth/venus combos that I could ever desire in reality, and they exist in a (non-physical) state something like the opposite of imagination (without definite form, because that is found when instatiated into physical). the sun is pretty good (and constantly getting better) at mapping the solar (2nd ray) perspective down into actual physical terms (lower half is symbolically relating, and upper half is conceptually/desire relating).
now, as a contrast to the thoth XY males, mars I consider to by a XX male, meaning he's only from earth -- which means that mars is basically earth (aphrodite), caused to have a masculine form -- and I believe that's accomplished by the number of different pyramids that exist on both earth and mars (pyramids btw have a strong effect on DNA, which is perceptual). mars and thoth are pretty similar though because the both have a brain (2nd ray), and also seem to perceive astral very strongly (especially when boosting astral/pineal stuff through sex magick), and so mars, when he's seeing astral is very similar to thoth in being stuck inside of the narrative.

the saturnian-system is the 4th ray form of perception, which is the midpoint around where subatomic (symbolic) and atomic (conceptual) meet, and this system is essentially the earth's way of regulating itself. saturn represents the part of the creation that is most stuck: all of the cultural narrative, and everyone's responce to it. the responce/reaction that we all have to the various symbols is how we navigate the infinitely many solar reality configurations: for example, if I find a getting a venus wife detestable, and settling into the day job of my choice, then I navigate myself *away* from those symbolic realities, because they don't feel good to me (or maybe I'm used to feeling bad, so I go with the wife cause I don't know what else to do). most people (ie venus and thoth) only perceive the *symbolic* (outside-in) part of the saturnian-system, and so interact with it on a symbolic level (usually in the imagination), however everything seen, felt, heard, experienced *is a concept* that exists inside of the brain, and so all of the cultural (and experiential) baggage of that symbol comes with it, and so has a feeling to it. therfore the saturnian-system itself (from the outside-in perspective) is a reflector of our inner concepts, and actually has little to do with reality. any movements made in the saturnian system are self moving their perspective around inside the infinite possiblities found in the sun, and so because they just navigated theirself to another (symbolic) solar "timeline" (path) that they like the feeling of. the system (because its a midpoint) is itself reflective of ourselves and all of our concepts (ie perception) of how reality works (inside the brain).
I brought up mars in the previous section as a contrast, because presently my understanding is that mars is quite reflective, and thoth isn't quite as reflective. thoth (+7) is an emitter, and so therefore is trying to prove the narrative reality he's been born with (genetically) and the one he's acquired mentally from cultural and social input. so, even if thoth, vulcan, or venus interact with the system, it's still a reflective system of their own brain's concepts.
    I've also noticed another effect here while I'm on the subject, and that is that it seems that the sun (perhaps actually it's all things going at subatomic+ speeds) is that these people seem to have outside-in perception (like the sun). for men, one of the things that I noticed is that around the anus is a vibrating circle at the base chakra, and I believe that (not sure if it's the same for females), that when the circle is broken, it has the effect of turning perception from inside-out to outside-in. there's good reason for it too, and I think it has entirely to do with the speed of one's perception: anal sex has the prostate/cervix and eyes pointed in the same direction, so it's like a fan with another fan mounted on top turning on, which the net result is that the two fans both go faster. it would go indefinitely faster, but there is resistance to it continually vibrating faster (dampening effect), and I think that has something to do with the anus circle -- so once that speed goes fast enough, now it passes through the midpoint and everything inverts (like the earth around the place of the crust), and now things are perceived from an outside-in perspective. somehow (and I'm not quite sure why), the effect of breaking the circle removes a man's reflectivity.
saturn (+-4) I believe is not any single guy, but instead a collection of all of the thoth types that have given up on the cultural narrative as maintained by jupiter->venus and mars->thoth, and have elected to instead pick the non-conflicting lifestyle of homosexuality (cause the fans are going the same way). therefore, I essentially consider the saturnian triad to be the maintainers of order and stability for the earth: thoth does what he's narrated to do, until he gives up on it and goes emitter (top), and that works for as long as thoth has temperance to his emission and doesn't start attracting too strongly unwanted, because at some point, he'll eventually realise that it is good to not only give but, also to receive (like timon of athens) -- and so now these saturnian types are kundalini inspired to react to everything that is around them based on the way his interpretation of the symbols feel (when they feel good or bad he's inspired to make sounds or actions). this whole interaction of saturn reacting maintains the cultural narrative that thoth is so busy fighting against (and poor venus is just the symbolic reflector to those guys).

### 2023-12-22 03:30 - venus and isis

venus (the planet) and isis (the sun) have an interesting relationship which manifests itself here on earth. the example I'll give is this: imagine that our thoughts emanate out of us like signals; some are of longer wavelength (sound, heat/IR, etc.) and some are of shorter wavelength (astral/UV, concepts/emotions/x-ray+), and these interact with the environment, and in some cases produce signals that are so small of a wavelength, they're subatomic. now, we can imagine the subatomic (upper half of 4, 3-1) as having a structured/coherent part to it (3), and an unstructured/incoherent part to it (upper half of 2, 1): the structured part is like a net of vibrating particles that are essentially designed to "catch" (because the incoming light/vibration is similar enough) the vibration and then bounce it back into the atomic wavelengths (spectral, coceptual, emotional, astral, physical). the role that venus plays is exactly the one that I described with the net example. she represents the "glass ceiling" of all known symbols and how they can be translated into something tangible. as an example: if I were to imagine or project out a symbol of abundance in relation to my own life (or someone else's), that symbol of abundance can only appear in a way that is *logical* to me: meaning, it has to com5 from something physical (like a real person giving me something), astral (like an abundant dream/vision), conceptual (a feeling/emotion of abundance), or the spectral (perception that abundance is a gradient, found in everything in some amount). those "manifestations" of that symbol (abundance) ultimately change how I feel, and therefore cOnceptualise my world around me, which further attracts more manifestations that are symbolically similar/resonant.
	that symbolic system of manifestations having a symbolic resonance to them, is *quite limited*, because the *meaning* of a symbol can often mean vary quite a lot from person to person and culture to culture (and any other social system inbetween, along with others). the other difficulty is that symbol is constantly changing. just look at the difference between how one person may read the book of revelation in the the 500s vs 1000s, vs today; or, how one may interpret the symbols presented by shakespere in his time vs 1700s, vs today. the symbols, though constant in theirselves, are constantly changing in the minds of those conceptualising them (putting skin/reality) on to the symbol by relating them to their point in *Time*. each of these different conceptual realisations of a symbol is going to put a slightly different *spin* on the symbol, allowing for something that is unchanging to morph as it travels through time.
	the morphing quality of this symbol in each person's mind *is* the spectral/saturnian system: on the upper part, there is the visual/symbolic system where venus determines (through the realisation of our own narrative) what is the way that the manifestation of those symbols into physical/astral/conceptual/spectral form, and not break the functioning of the whole.
the way that isis fits into all of this, is that there are simply symbols that do not fit into venus' version of reality: as an example, let's say that I want to make a thing that is available to everyone, and it's free; well, if the society that will receive such a symbol is incapable of conceptualising it (it has to come from the gods, or a person can only get what they *earn*) -- then these are beliefs that prevent the manifestation of that symbol into those social systems; so, these are signals that slip through that web-like strutcture and head off into oblivion. they were too fast to catch (ie, "ahead of their time"), and so they continue on toward the sun. thoth (being a 7th ray) also has a chance to catch the signal, as well -- and he can catch anything that he's narrated to do so -- so for example, let's say that venus *likes* the symbol that I wanted to create, and wants it to exist (cause of some calculated desire), so she narrates thoth to be able to perform some symbolic things which will make its manifestation possible. if neither of them can catch the symbol and do something with it, then the sun receives it. isis isn't looking at necessarily the symbolic aspect of any of it -- but because she receives all of the things that don't quite make it, she's got a catalogue of symbols that couldn't be manifested into the mind of venus or thoth, and so these stay inside of the sun vibrating in the form of each individual concept as they were perceived by those who originally perceived the symbol.
	to explain, if I perform something physically (like a play or a masque) that has a symbolic component to it, the sequence of actions in the presentation produce an emotional response in both the actors and the audience (like, just imagine how many people thought "ooooh, bertram isn't quite what I'd want for helena"). these reactions are cOncepts/emotions that com5 as a result of *desire* -- and so because those reactions have no symbolic way of manifesting at that point in time, then sun keeps those concept/desires/reactions alive and vibrating, so that eventually they begin to mix with others' similarly vibrating concepts until a suitable symbolic form can be created.
after there is sufficient energy/magnitude of resonating concepts, the sun will eventually "get blown up" and explode, forcing a new symbolic reality to emerge, causing then venus to have to recalculate all of the now symbolic reality, according to the new system. these explosions happen all of the time (uncountable times per second) on the surface of the sun, but sometimes when enough emotional reactions have built up, the magnitude is too much and the slightest trigger, and the sun makes a very big change: toward one that is desired by many. how many? I'm not really sure, because everyone attracts diffrerently, so I'd say it happens always when the attraction for the new symbolic system is greater than the resistance is against it.
	obviously, a new system is very unwanted for those that already have reality setup and cruising just the way they want it to go (usually the elites), so the way that they combat reality being slippery, and transforming into what anyone desires it to be, is to build up a lot of expectations about "how things work" -- and so we're supposed to accept that "this is just how it is" and that's why we can't have what we want. (as an example, it's a normal thought today for a person to just assume that a very small percentage of people can get the conditions that they want), and so it's assumed that's "just the way it is" -- and so we expect that to be the way it is. as an example, imagine I had someone take care of me all of my life and provide for all of my needs (cause I was disabled in some way). if/when I go to a new environment, I'll expect someone to take care of me, in just the same way, and if there isn't anyone that can do that, well then obviously what needs to happen is that I need to figure out how to project out the actions which others should take so that I can get taken care of (the way it should be done). this form of desire is to maintain things always as they are presently -- and never to create a new system, whereby (in this contrived example), I'm now able to take care of myself. 3rd ray always want to maintain the present system, and make sure it's running as smoothely as possible.
3rd rays are always focused on conditions and whether they're being maintained, from a symbolic/calculated perception (which is really good for stability) but goes directly in the face of desire, which are emotional/conceptual *reactions* to those conditions: this could be better; and if the improvement fits in and doesn't break any existing code, then it's allowed, but (like a mature software project), no "breaking changes" are allowed. desire wants new things, and the sun aggregates these desires, until the desire is stronger than the resistance to it (ie, when the code/social-system is so broken) that it's no longer functional to the majority of those using it. 2nd rays (like the sun), don't care about maintaining the system, but more for bringing about what the perceived "common good" is. human 2nd ray perception (which is all of us because we all have a brain) has a much more limited perception than the sun does, and so when we want to bring about the "common good" for everone, it's usually limited to the common good of the social group. many wars are fought with both sides believing their common good is more important -- and yet they're both fighting for the common good: it's a scope issue cause nobody can conceive of the all (especially in a symbolic sense)
	there's actually something to that, which is best understood by the spectral: if I were to show a pixel with a colour for every person based on their mood, I could get a general sense of how everyone feels (especially if I grouped the pixels into areas of similar colours); however, those pixels cannot tell me what everyone wants, or how they want to feel. for that, I'd need a second layer of pixels to show the extra information -- but it's still not very helpful. I couldr further simplify the data by grouping people into different spaces or whatever, but there's always going to be a loss of data when perceived symolically. yet, if, instead of pixels, I consider each one of them as a signal (imagine thousands of sounds), and I added all of them together: that single sound (after blowing my eardrums out) represents the aggregate of how everyone feels in that m6ment -- and if I listen to that sounnd as it transforms over time, I can hear a trajectory to the sound. as I listen to the sound, I can tell how dissonant or resonant the sound is with myself, and so eventually, it'll arrive to a harmonious sound that I like and can sympathise with, upon which I'll have (myself) an emotional reaction to the sound: an outburst that says "yes, I like that". venus is the symbolic perception, trying to aggregate and simplify the data in such a way where it makes logical sense, and the sun is like me: reacting emotionally to the dissonance/resonance of all of the concepts stored in its body. the sun's reactions to those sounds (like solar flares) also shape the sound, by amplifying certain things, so that the sound (which, in the sun's case is an aggregate of all humans and planets, including venus, in the solar system) becomes a combined desire of all that's wanted/felt. we're a (physical) mirror of the sun's concept/hydrogen, and the sun is a (conceptual) reflection of the (physical) solar system.
