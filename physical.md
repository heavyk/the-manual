### 2023-09-18 13:43 - XY & YX

I equate the Y with 2nd ray perception. one can think of this y-chromosome as the sort of soul-reflector. the soul "lives" (if it needs to be located, with the sun, and so therefore is 2nd ray in perception). the solar instantiation of a person's "soul" is a symbolic system that essentially plugs right into the solar computer, and it orchestrates the necessary energetic environment for the desired/attracted reality that is constructed symbolically in a similar manner inside of our minds. all things desired are possible, instantly -- just it's always the difference between our brain's 2nd ray perception, and the sun's 2nd ray perception. as such, because our brain and everything we perceive is all relatioal (the symbolic part, is *our effort* to try and make it absolute/fixed/unchanging) -- and so 2nd ray perception sees a literal infinite ways to get to the desire, and so therefore the sun is interested in allowing us to continue to live over and over our own way to creating a frequency that matches the desire (usually the symbol stuff just isn't dynamic enough, or resonates with some other (unintended) things).
  the X, on the otherhand is a sort of monopole, more than having the duality of the Y. I consider these (primary) form of perception to be very much a one-sided engagement. they are only what they really are, because they're *only* attraction. all of the blended/relative rays (2,4,6) are a blend of either, so therefore -- I always imagine this like a square or cube, and perceive all points thtat could land distant from the diagonal (root-2/3) as all of the different possiblities, yet the more X-like (primary), it is the closer it is to passing through the centre diagonal. therefore, all of the 2nd rays are *mental* in ttheir creation, all reflections of their creator and interactors (just like a concept).
  an X perceives things in their most *realist* (attracted) form, adhering as closely to posible of the diagonal (minimal distance, most optimised/attracted/purest result): it *is* what it is. it's not some thing that could be one tthing, but symolically it matches another, so all of a sudden it tranforms into the new image of what I believe the concept to be.
personally, I think it matters which chromosome comes on the left (cells have chirality), and which one com5s on the right. when I use my left-hand, I am very notably using m/ Y (my genetic 2nd ray perception), and I think that's one of the reasons why nosebook has my left-side disabled: because that side would dominate, and my perception would take over (transform/modify) the sun's 2nd ray aspect. anyway, that side is very generous (it's better to give than to receive) and wants everyone to experience their desire... when I'm using my right-side though, it's completely different, as now I'm thinking more in terms of performance, optimisation, cutting corners, or selfishly what *I* want, and nobody else. I obviously don't want to have (visible) 2nd ray perception, but my brain and the symbol I'm using to write this is all relational (from my perspective), and (mostly) no narrative, so my own desire
  relational perspective is different from a symbolic perspective. let's take the example of someone getting murdered or something. one guy says, "she had it coming to her". another one says, "you live by the sword, you die by the sword". "she should have known, that if she does that, then she'll get herself killed" -- cause those are all narrative. the way I see all of those things as good (and sometimes valid) explanations, but they're not really what is really happening. *it's all attraction*; so, whatever she did to get herself killed was a proper reflection of her desire to die (that is fear, or depression, dread, worry, etc. -- depression because a person feels powerless and without desire to make any improvement on their present situation, so since I'm stuck, I'll just accept this situation as my reality) -- and so from the relational perspective, I can look at the feeling of the person (and those around, also with expectations), and start to get a bigger "picture" (though it's more like a lot of things that feel/sound/suena differente), and I start to *understand* how all of the symbolically random things, match not the meaning, butt thee feeling of of the component parts.
I've also paid a lot of attention to left-handed people, as I too display a tendency toward it, because my symbolic (left) side would get activated, and that would happen when I started to write and do things of symbolic nature with my left hand. I also noticed a lot of attraction-retarded people tend to use their right hand (or doodle/draw abstract things, usually without words/symbol), probably from not wanting to cast "spells" on theirself by writing things they (now/don't) want to experience. for me, the distinction between how those diffreent sides "feel" (to me), is quite noticeable, and left-handed people feel very different to me, cause their brains are ...
  I experience both, so I'll explain what I mean: 2nd ray perception has an emissive/absorbative symbolic side, and also a emissive/absorbative attraction/desire side to it. when emitting symbols, there's no guarantee how those symbols get converted into concepts on the receiver side, and so there's no guarantee -- and because the the other part is attraction, the spellcaster has to be sure, also for theirself, what their symbols *actually* "mean" to them -- because we symbolically calculate our desire all the time and realise "thatt's not quite it" -- and have to adjust and try again, cause in a symbolic system, *all* of the conditions/branches have to accounted for, else there's a bug in the code/narrative. if there's anything unexpected, the unexpected turns into whatever it feels like -- and for most people unexpected is bad, not like a surprise or gift, or a discovery -- which is bad. unless a person has all of their symbols well defined for all moments (nobody does), emitting symbol could have very unwanted self-results, and no control over how others conceptualise those symbols (which is why 2nd ray is all about convincing/mutual-back-scratching/shmoozing).
the way I look at 2nd ray perception is that deep deep down, there is a pure-desire, and it's extremely selfish and self-serving (this is the soul), but as we grow up, we're taught there are others around in the world too, and not everwyone can want everything, and you need limitation -- all of this symbolic crap that goes covering over (like a veil or tinted spectacles) all of the way that the "soul" sees it. it's own own brain, which comes from culture, and all things social -- and so it's only us that's turning away that pure-desire 2nd ray perspective. it's possible to go live separated from most other people in order to avoid a lot of that crap which veils the 2nd ray perception, but that's not fun. instead, it's easier just to lower resistance and see all things as being (according to their capacity) extremely selfish, because if they're conscious of self, they want improvements for self (whether they act like it or not).
  every thing that covers over the 2nd ray pure-desire perception, are all of these monopole things: desire (what I think *I* (and others) want), symbol (my physical-self's narrative/the-manual), concept (what I think everything *is*), and physicality (the way things *are*). these are all the seeming (from our observer perspective), all of the things that are emitting in my reality, yet they're not emitting at all -- but are actually all attracted/received; physical is very backwards.
