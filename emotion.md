# (5) emotion

### 2023-08-13 07:20 - concept vs data/reality = emotion

when I go around and see people, every person that I meet for the first time, or see again for the thousandth time today, they are always the most advanced/sophisticated/complex/evolved concept of theirself; however they often don't appear that way in the physical where I meet them, and that's because there are a lot of different reasons why we are not capable of seeing/feeling ourselves as that most advanced version, which often times has a lot to do with things that I focus my attention on (and absorb that cOnceptual vibration from), but mostly it's things that I *believe* which keep me from seeing/feeling myself as that most advanced/sophisticated concept of myself.
  it's important (I believe) to make a distinction here between the physical cOncept and the non-physical (or, at least outside of the visible spectrum) concept. the physical cOncept is simply the activation state of the brain, and probably a lot of really complex stuff going on in the "junk DNA" part of the cell,
    in fact, I would love to find out more about this because I don't really know, because the way that I experience this is that there's one part of me that's going at one frequency (let's say that's the junk part), but there's another part of me that's going at a different frequency (let's say that's my brain), and even though the cells of my body are capable/carrying an ever higher frequency to them as I go through life, it's actually m/ brain which is incapable of keeping up with that increasing frequency. in short, I'd consider the "junk" part there to be the collection/summation of all of the concepts that I've encountered in my life, yet my brain only really understands a small portion of it. I think this accounts for a lot of cultural encoding into the DNA as well as a lot of what we consider "ageing" -- because that frequency will continue to rise, and the brain will want to stay harmonious with that -- or let's say some new concepts will be encountered which will modify the cultural/environmental encoding, and so one will find theirselves ageing because they're continuing tto try and work with the old concept
  which I think has a lot to do with how we present ourselves visually to people; what I mean is, I believe that each cell (probably in the nucleus) emits an amount of light (probably similar to the sun), and I believe that this reflects the cell's own concept/resonance of that vibration, and that light that's emitted *attracts* to it the things that resonate with that (which is how I believe blood flow works too, btw) -- so when somebody seems to have that "glow" about them, that's always (IMO) a reflection of their emotional state, and I belive that comes from the emission spectrum of all of the different cells' nuclei.
  I don't have it all worked out just yet, but as best as I can figure it, I notice that the brain is one aspect, then there's another aspect which is part of the body (so probably celular/nuclear), and the final aspect is an emination of the "soul" (or source) -- the very non-physical concept of ourselves that is essentially pure *desire*, and that desire attracts essentially or conceptually, based on *emotion*: "how do I want to feel" -- and so as I pass through different parts of my physical experience, those parts are all different emotions that I wanted to experience (because I focused on them and therefore attracted them).
what's important to note though is that my physical body is *always* far far behind the real concept of myself, which is why my body gets tired, ages, and when I look at another person, I see them not as the brilliant concept that they are, but the physical representation that best describes the cOncept that they're projecting.
  if I were able to perceive them as that higher frequency concept, and not the physical one, then they would always look magnificent and wonderful to me, no matter how they are in their physical state. nobody would look old, tired, fat, ugly, or any other physical manifestation which *symbolises* a concept other than what I see them.
    it's important to notice that my brain always renders a person (much like a dream) as the symbol of the emotion/concept that they're projecting, combined with my present form of perception.
      so, for example, if I feel really good, it's often the case that I see/conceptualise a person as being much more beautiful/nice/well/etc than they think theirself to be, and it's not because of anything they did, but has only to do with the way that my brain turns their higher frequency concept into things which are meaningful *to me*, which relate to how I conceptualise/feel them.
    I actually think that others have this happen as well, but perhaps to a lesser extent, probably because they've trained their brain (like we teach children) to see the physical aspect of a person (the way that *they* see theirselves), and not the way that *I* want to see them; because I still prefer to see things the way that I want to see things, I think that has a dramatic effect on how I perceive other people. (they project their concept/emotion of who they feel theirself to be in that moment of their life, and I take that and then see them the way I want to see them). I don't want to see other people the way they want me to see them; I prefer to see everyone the way I want to see them (because my way is usually lower resistance).
      there are sometimes the case when someone projects a higher frequency concept of theirselves than I see of them, and that often times causes a reason for suspicion, because I often times *want* to see them as the higher frequency version, but I know that it's often times *not* what they actually see theirselves, and is usually conditional, or based on expectation/deceit (as in, they want something from me).
  the way that I perceive the other person is always a reflection of how I am *emotionally*, and so I then get some instant feedback on that perception, because the way I'm seeing/perceiving them is causing me to feel an emotion. that emotion ("who they really are") will intersect with my brain's cOncept of them, and then cause me then to feel a visceral response to that emotion (like, say attraction, repulsion, desire, apathy, etc.).
    there is: their physical concept of theirself (brain/body) and their non-physical concept of theirself (soul/source); then there's: my physical concept of them (brain/body) and also my non-physical concept of them all interacting at once to produce the visceral feeling in my body that we call "emotion" -- but that feeling felt in the body is *not* the emotion itself, but a manifestation of that emotion, which is essentially a comparision between my physical/non-physical concept of them and their physical/non-physical concept of theirself (there may be others involved as well). those combined then produce a frequency (in the astral/imagination (6)) that my body then "feels" (which obviously is just my *interpretation* of that emotion, not the emotion itself).
    because we think that interpretation of the emotion *is* the emotion, we often times deceive ourselves, believing the visceral feeling to be the "real" emotion, when often times, the visceral feeling is quite contrary to the "still small voice" that's behind the emotion.
      this is often the case for many layers of deception, because I can project out a feeling and cause someone to feel a strong visceral feeling in their heart of hate/desire/love/anger -- when that feeling is *not* the emotion, but actually just my body/brain's interpretation of that cOncept that is being emitted. when *anything* feels bad, it's *always* the case, that I'm misinterpretting the emotion, because I don't *really* feel that way; it's just my physical concepts (social-conceptual-framework) which are telling my body that I should feel one way or another about some projected cOncept.
      sales people do this all the time, when they effort to get the client to feel good about one thing or another -- when they don't *really* feel good about that thing, and their astral body is just reacting to the projected concept, in a way which feels good.
        it's easy to do: let's say I want to sell a product, so what I've done is find out a way that my client wants to feel (let's say productive, or successful), and so then as I'm describing the product, I use words and ideas (or just plainly project out the feeling directly from my heart) a feeling of productivity and success in relation (2) to that product, which then the client feels in their astral body and because now they (along with the product) feel successful and productive, they want that product, because they want that feeling -- so they buy it because that product now symbolises productivity and success.
      the other people that do this often are PUAs, as they have an entire toolkit designed to get their target to viscerally feel certain ways by associating/relating concepts using wordplay, anchoring, and other means.
      the way we relate concepts and feelings to symbols (2) is everything that marketing and propaganda is all about, as it's important to associate good/powerful/beneficial-feeling concepts to the symbols that they want (their brand/nation/war/etc).
    in my personal experience, emotion (the thing behind the feeling) is never felt (that's the interpretation), but is always *known* -- and be careful where that knowing comes from too: is it intuitive, or is it coming from the brain (after weighing pros and cons) or is it coming from mom/culture/friends, or is it actually something that I know deep down inside, and has less/more feeling of resistance to it than the present situation? ("everything is alright", "they don't really mean that", "there's probably a better way to look at that")
      I say more resistant, because often times resistance shows up internally for me when that concept is producing action which isn't going in the direction that I *really* want to go (which is always toward lower resistance). I think of these things like nudges: they are more resistance for a moment, but it's just a bit of resistance to keep me from going a way I don't *really* want to go.
