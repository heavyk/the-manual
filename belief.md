# belief

belief is the structure and form of actions; the process that they undergo to produce a result. it's a symbolic system in which all operations are essentially the same as math formulas (both sides of the equals sign must by balanced, cause every action has an equal and opposite re-action).

### cOnsequences

*all* consequences are a literary/symbolic creation of our own mentation, and so just like the symboliic (3), all layers of perception below it (4-7), are extensions of the symbolic. in addition to consequences for actions being a literary/symbolic creation, so too is justice, and the laws of science. the process of these symbolic interactions moving from non-physical (1-4.5) into physical (4.5-7) happens because we *believe* it happens that way; someone at some time believed that non-physical desire/attraction makes its way into reality through a series of passageways and sequences of actions, and then taught/spread the ideas (5) out to other beings which also believed it (3), and so everything I perceive is "real" becaause I/we *believe* (3) it's real.
  desire is vibration that does not yet have structure or form in which it can manifest, and so therefore (because there's no symbolic system/consequence for its manifestation), it desires to take on form. in order for a desire to become manifest, it must travel through the (non-physical) symbolic system (of our own mentation), down into something that is at first most tangible in the physical: a cOncept or a emotion (a notion, idea, knowing, understanding, etc). from there, the chain reaction continues on down filling the imagination (6) of those receptive to the idea (5), and then finally/hopefully someone will take that concept (5) and turns it into something fully physical (7).
    if I can *feel* (viserally or tangibly) the that's not the emotion or concept itself, but the brain's (7) interpretation (6) of that concept (5), which is a poor interpretation; consider that the imagination can (usually) only look at any thing/idea from one angle at a time, and isn't capable Of beholding the idea/thing in its entirety, experiencing it from all angles at the same time. the physical (7) is locked into one angle of perception at once and so is therefore bound by time and space, yet the concept itself is not bound by time or by space. a good example of this could be a computer program (5) that produces a song dynamically. at any moment in time my physical ears (7) are hearing the song, but there's no way for me to hear the song in its enterity all at the same time -- for to do that, I would behold/experience the program itself (5), and not the song (7) it produces.
  ironically our/my desire is also to determine ahead of time, how any desire will manifest itself into my reality; that is, to know ahead of its manifestation, the consequences of its arrival. in order to do that, I perceive (2) the desire as unfolding into a series of actions/symbols (3) which will then cause (4) me to feel (5) a certain way about any one of those actions/symbols, in response to how I perceive (2) them.
    my percepttion (2) ultimately becomes the determinining factor for how I feel (5) and therefore conceptualise that series of actions. I want the way that I feel about the actions to match how others feel about the actions, which is what we call *justice*: I don't want others to feel good (because of their perception (2)) good about something that I feel bad about, so therefore there should be some sort of consequences or *recompense* to make the performer of the action *feel* the same way that I feel about the same actions.
      a good example of this is when I see someone working really hard and it feels to me like they should be adequately compensated for their efforts, and so I decide that I need to make an action to ensure they feel the way I think they should feel.
