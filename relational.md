### 2023-08-11 09:38 - all symbols relate to each other conceptually

every symbol has a frequency to it, and so therefore many concepts resonate with that symbol (but are not the symbol itself). consider that the symbol is like a function or an action, in that it performs or does something. the way that any performance relates to another can be related in action (ie, the same steps/actions performed), but they can also relate to each other in the way that they *feel*: conceptually. the way that they feel has to do with the *reason*, *why*, or desire that is behind the action (but not the action itself).
  this is the most interesting thing to notice about symbols, simply because a symbol is inert in its performance, aiming (like modern day science and mathematics) to just perform a series of transformations isolating all of the external variables (such as desire (1), environment (7), and the conceptual framework in which the experiment is being performed). as a result, it's often the case that *different results* will come out of identical actions, and that's because symbol is, itself *not physical*, and so therefore cannot be related...
    as an example, consider the relationship between addition and multiplication: they are similar in that multiplication is repeated addition, but knowledge of that does nothing to relate (for example) `7*7` and `8*2`; we can see now when we look at it conceptually that 7 is a prime and also squared, wheras 8 is `2^3` and so that can be rewritten as `2^4`. one equation is odd and the other is even, and so both equations *feel* very differently, even though symbolically, they look exactly the same: `n*n`. it isn't until we put physical values into the symbol of `n*n`, do we begin to see how they relate.
