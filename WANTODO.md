#### new keywords
- (1) attraction
- (2) expectation
- (3) archetype (protocol)

#### topics
- 7th rays want to figure out what is wanted/desired, and then turn that into physical/conceptual reality. (just like concepts want to know symbols and vice-versa)
- concept and symbol differences can also be illustrated from outside-in or inside-out
- all physical reality is *received* (the body is an array of sensors and antennas)
  - I can choose what I want to attract (1), by choosing how I want to perceive (2) everything in my experience.
  - all perception (2) is conceptual (5)
- any translation of a concept we do is *always* outdated, because of evolution-of-desire and our physical senses capacity to *receive* that concept (limitation of the antenna)
  - concept&physical are mostly *received*, whereas symbol&desire are mostly *emitted* (which is why humans don't glow).
- difference between symbolic/logical and conceptual/feeling thinking
  - conceptul logic (and how I experience things like comparison of frequencies -- musicians and others have the same ability for identifying sound/notes)
- pure desire, centre perspective, and what it's like to see the relational from the perspective of pure desire: I want the best for everyone and I love to see all things in motion/chaos toward improvement/expansion/realisation.
- pure-evil always gets defeated by "good"

#### improvements
- explain that this is the-manual (to the way I conceptualise reality)
- track usage of "you" (fine inside quotes, but otherwise I want to speak only in 1st person)
- add glossary/keywords which map all the synonyms to their articles (RegEx matching)
  - symbol: symbolic, symbolises, etc.
- parse the document, and find links to concepts (word-word) and ideas (/file.md) that don't exist (for completeness)

#### interface
- parse and render markdown into html elements (complete with links and popups like wikipedia and stuff)
- auto generate links to keywords (expect->expectation, believe->belief, etc)
- build interactive svg illustrating the layers in both top to bottom and also in pyramidal building on eachother form (especially good illustration for the 11 layers).
  - generally, I also want to illustrate other ideas visually as well, as for me, I want to mimic how I "see" all of the different words and concepts that I use as being connected together. (ex. show a symbol, give an example meaning to it, then define its properties to give it a reason, then show it's desire/experience, then turn the idea around and show the same thing from a conceptual point of view (like I do in words -- but more structured/visually)).
    - when I was a child, it was *very* helpful for me to *see* what the person was saying, and to have multiple examples so I can begin to build up a pattern -- as once I can see the pattern, I can start to see/extrapolate it into other things.
