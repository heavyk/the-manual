# WANTODO

new keywords:
- (1) attraction
- (2) expectation
- (3) archetype (protocol)

topics:
- pure desire as how I want to feel

improvements:
- explain that this is the-manual (to the way I conceptualise reality)
- track usage of "you" (fine inside quotes, but otherwise I want to speak only in 1st person)
- add glossary/keywords which map all the synonyms to their articles (RegEx matching)
  - symbol: symbolic, symbolises, etc.

interface:
- parse and render markdown into html elements (complete with links and popups like wikipedia and stuff)
- auto generate links to keywords (expect->expectation, believe->belief, etc)
- build interactive svg illustrating the layers in both top to bottom and also in pyramidal building on eachother form (especially good illustration for the 11 layers).
  - generally, I also want to illustrate other ideas visually as well, as for me, I want to mimic how I "see" all of the different words and concepts that I use as being connected together. (ex. show a symbol, give an example meaning to it, then define its properties to give it a reason, then show it's desire/experience, then turn the idea around and show the same thing from a conceptual point of view (like I do in words -- but more structured/visually)). when I was a child, it was *very* helpful for me to *see* what the person was saying, and to have multiple examples so I can begin to build up a pattern -- as once I can see the pattern, I can start to see/extrapolate it into other things.
