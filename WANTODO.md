# WANTODO

new keywords:
- (1) attraction
- (2) expectation
- (3) archetype (protocol)

topics:
- pure desire as how I want to feel

improvements:
- explain that this is the-manual (to the way I conceptualise reality)
- track usage of "you" (fine inside quotes, but otherwise I want to speak only in 1st person)
- add glossary/keywords which map all the synonyms to their articles (RegEx matching)
  - symbol: symbolic, symbolises, etc.

interface:
- parse and render markdown into html elements (complete with links and popups like wikipedia and stuff)
- auto generate links to keywords (expect->expectation, believe->belief, etc)
